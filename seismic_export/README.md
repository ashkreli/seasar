Seismic signal processing code

`toa_calculate.mlx`: calculate time of arrival of wavefront(s) given
a single trial file
`corroborate_toa.mlx`: generate an array of times where 2+ sensors detected
a wavefront given arrays generated by `toa_calculate`
`seismic_detection_final.mlx`: Final detection determination
and some data analysis starter code that loops through all the files
